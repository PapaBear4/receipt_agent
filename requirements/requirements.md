# Receipt Processing Agent - Requirements Document

## Overview
The Receipt Processing Agent is an automated system that monitors multiple input sources for receipts, extracts relevant financial data, and forwards it to financial tracking services. 

## Core Objectives
- **Automate receipt capture** from multiple sources
- **Extract structured data** from unstructured receipt documents
- **Integrate with financial tracking** services
- **Maintain data accuracy** and provide error handling
- **Support multiple receipt formats** (photos, PDFs, email attachments)

## System Architecture

### High-Level Flow
```
Receipt Sources → Detection/Triggers → Processing Pipeline → Data Extraction → Financial Service Integration
```

### Components
1. **Trigger System** - Monitors input sources
2. **Receipt Processing Engine** - Extracts and structures data
3. **Data Validation Layer** - Ensures accuracy and completeness

## Data Flow

### 1. Receipt Detection
```
Source → Trigger Event → Initial Validation → Queue for Processing
```

### 2. Data Extraction
```
Raw Receipt → Preprocessing → OCR/Text Extraction → LLM Analysis → Structured Data
```

### 3. Validation & Enhancement
```
Extracted Data → Field Validation → Merchant Lookup → Category Assignment → Quality Score
```

### 4. Financial Integration
```
Validated Data → Service Formatting → API Submission → Confirmation → Archive
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories
1. **Input Errors**: Unreadable images, corrupted files
2. **Extraction Errors**: OCR failures, unclear text
3. **Validation Errors**: Missing required fields, invalid amounts
4. **Integration Errors**: API failures, network issues
5. **Business Logic Errors**: Duplicate transactions, categorization conflicts

### Error Response Actions
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Processing**: Alternative extraction methods
- **Manual Review Queue**: Flag complex cases for human review
